# makepasswd
Generates passwords like OSX. This is merely an exercise of programming in Golang. Use the `makepasswd` package on Linux to generate secure passwords that uses a better random generator instead of the pseudorandom-generator in Go.

The function for the performant string generation was acquired from here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22892120/how-to-generate-a-random-string-of-a-fixed-length-in-golang.
